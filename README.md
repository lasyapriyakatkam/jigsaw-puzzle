1. Hey GPT! I want to create a jigsaw picture puzzle game within an hour. Can you provide me with idea?
2. Guide me with detailed steps starting with setting up enviroment to create this app, project creation, files to put in the project, project structure and code 
3. I was able to upload an image and it has shuffled the pieces automatically. But I'm not able to move the pieces to solve the puzzle. I would like a more dynamic version
4. when I click on shuffle now, I see index.html:19 
            
            
           GET file:///C:/Users/lasya/jigsaw-puzzle-game/images/sample.jpg net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND this error in console
5. puzzle solved notification is not coming automatically once it is solved. Can we fix that? Also, clicking on shuffle doesn't change anything. Can we change that too?
6. Solve button should reset the image to original order. right now it just gives an alert saying puzzle solved successfully
7. Still it is giving the popup only. It is not resetting the puzzle
8. That worked!
9. This looks basic. Can you make it look like a real game? Also, can we cut the pieces in jigsaw pattern and not just squares?
10. Drag and drop is not working properly. For few of the squares I'm not able to drop them even after multiple tries. Also, I dont see Jig-saw shaped pieces.
11. Please use other tech stack if you think current tech stack is basic. If required, we can create a new project but please take care of the issues and make it look professional and also please make sure drag and drop works smoothly
12. yes please provide detailed project setup and code
13. where to download konva.js and where do i place it?
14. I dont see any indication when the puzzle is solved. Also, the image doesn't fit in the outer square. This looks awkward. Can we make it more proportional. Please do not break anything while doing this.
15. that worked! 
16. The jig saw pieces are too out of shape. And, there are some pieces which have same part of image. Let's stick to the pieces shapes as shown in attached image. Please make sure the puzzle infact is solvable and no part of image is repeating in the puzzle pieces
17. yes please implement the specified changes and share the code changes
18. This looks so awkward. Let's stick to square pieces
19. Now can you make the container a little big and make the buttons look a little better
20. Increase the size of the container a little more
21. Image is being cut. Can you ensure we are using the full image
22. still the same issue
23. Can you review and give me edited files? I'm still facing the same issue where entire image is not being used. 
24. I'm not able to download files. Can you give them in the chat itself
25. when the puzzle is solved. Can you add a notification?
26. Now, let's focus on aesthetics. the file upload button looks basic. can you make it look better?
27. Can you make the background fun? It looks very plain
28. I'm not able to find it. Can you update and give me the entire code so that I can replace ?
29. Looks good now. Can we make any more improvements ?
30. Lets do smoother dragging with snapping effect and animated shuffle effect first. And then add sound effects.
31. please provide the new files
32. I don't see the container or the image itself.
33. 1. Can I have a settings box on the side where I can control the difficulty
2. When I move the pieces, they are not clipped in the place nicely. Can you updat thie?
34. How do I host the applicaton on github
35. Give me all the prompts for this session in a txt
36. Give me the prompts in a list format.
37. Give me the prompts from the start of Jigsaw Puzzle Game Plan.
38. Provide the file in README.md format.
